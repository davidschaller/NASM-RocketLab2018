-You can put this into a terrain or anything, it's best to start off with it in an empty terrain which gives you the option of either a mesh or a splatmat texture.

In the path generator you get three options;
-Path points
-Settings
-Back ups

To put a path point down you just click 'path points' and then click 'S' where you want the path points. 
The points will show on  terrain and you can move them which will change the path.

If you go into 'terrain' -> 'mesh' and then put texture into the map you can modify with the height and width of the path.
There is also a 'raise terrain' function which will raise the terrain up the the highest point of the path.
You can name your mesh in 'path points'

Use backups, these are there to restore the terrain to what it was previously if you mess up.

Using splat-maps over it can give this 'warped path' look. You acn raise the path as well using the 'raise terrain to path' option
